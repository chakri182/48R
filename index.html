<p><b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</b> is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. <mark>Other technologies besides HTML</mark> are generally used to describe a web <u>page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript)</u>.</p>

<h2>how it is useful?</h2>
<p><b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) </b>is useful <i>because it forms the basic structure</i> of every webpage on the internet. It allows developers to organize content using elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists. <u>HTML</u> works closely with CSS, which handles design, and <mark>JavaScript</mark>, which adds interactivity, making it an essential part of web development. Without HTML, browsers would not know how to display content properly. Itâ€™s easy to learn, beginner-friendly, and serves as the <del>foundation for anyone looking</del> to build <u>websites or pursue a career in web development.</u>
